this is a project we made in class 10 as a submission project of three subjects for Formative Assessment of second term!!
please do note that most of the contents are not owned by me; they taken from some other educational resources and internet; i am uploading here this our 4 year old project for the personal memory purpose only!!
of course another intention to upload is to archive all of those projects that i have done in different areas of science, mathematics, phyilosophy and engineering.
this project consists three subjects first the science; in which that time class 10 syllabus is covered, social science; in which minerals and global warming related issues are presented; and sanskrit; in whcih the major idea is to present bhagwad gita but some that time class 10 slokas are also presented.
i admit that not all of those slides are made by mu own, but i had done lot of  work  to put those together and arrange in a anner i understand and organize all those three projects under a single file namely HTML UI!!

thanks for reading this and coming over here!!
