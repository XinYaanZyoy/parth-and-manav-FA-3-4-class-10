# parth-and-manav-FA-3-4-class-10
this is a project we made in class 10 as a submission project of three subjects for Formative Assessment of second term!!
please do note that most of the contents are not owned by me; they taken from some other educational resources and internet; i am uploading here this our 4 year old project for the personal memory purpose only!!
of course another intention to upload is to archive all of those projects that i have done in different areas of science, mathematics, phyilosophy and engineering.
this project consists three subjects first the science; in which that time class 10 syllabus is covered, social science; in which minerals and global warming related issues are presented; and sanskrit; in whcih the major idea is to present bhagwad gita but some that time class 10 slokas are also presented.
i admit that not all of those slides are made by mu own, but i had done lot of  work  to put those together and arrange in a anner i understand and organize all those three projects under a single file namely HTML UI!!
and yes, those three ppsx(and not ppts!!) i have uploaded on my google drive not here because of some size limit of GitHub; so if you click on the download button you wouldn't be downloading instead what you would see is the output from google online ppsx viewr which unfortunately converts ppsx into ppt or kinda pdf so to have the bbetter visulations and media performance which i have worked specially on only; you would have to download from google drive; please do it if you want to enjoy these ppsx with multimedia effects!!

thanks for reading this and coming over here!!
